Ever wanted to customize your weapon with a whole ton of various weapon attachments like in Crysis? Well, now you can.

If you want a crap ton more weapons that support even more attachments, download Extra Customizable Weaponry from one of the following links (UPDATE 1):

I can't upload ECW to workshop because of the filesize limit.
Please make a clean installation of ECW every time an update for ECW is released.

To install Extra Customizable Weaponry, simply extract the archive into your addons folder. Make sure there is no duplicate Extra Customizable Weaponry folder inside it.

FAQ:
Q: IS THIS BASED ON MAD COW'S WEAPON BASE??????
A: No, this base is a very heavily modified default CS weapons that was back in GMod 12.

Q: How do I attach an attachment to a weapon?
A: Open your Q menu, and go to 'Entities'. Then, find a category called "Weapon Attachments".
Spawn attachments from there, pick them up by looking at them and pressing your use key.
After that, open up the weapon customization menu by pressing your CONTEXT MENU KEY and select the attachments you want by pressing the keys displayed in the brackets!
Simple, isn't it?

Q: I cannot see the attachments!
A: Some addons conflict with this. As such, you will not be able to see attachments.

Q: How can I increase my accuracy?
A: You can: stop moving, crouch down, aim down the sights, fire in short controlled bursts.

Q: How do I use the bipod?
A: Attach it to a weapon, walk up to a waist-high wall obstacle and stand still. The bipod will become active if it's possible to use it.

Q: I have 2 red dots when using various attachments.
A: That's because you have another aim2 texture that's interfering with the new one.
Search for aim2 and delete all of them (both the .vmts and .vtfs) that are not in the Customizable Weaponry folder.

Q: I don't have any ammo in reserve for all weapons!
A: Spawn the "Ammokit" SWEP in category "Throwable Weapons"

Q: The ACOG scope has this reflection on it and I can barely see anything.
A: You have another pair of ACOG model textures in your GMod folder somewhere, which are over-writing the current ACOG lense texture
